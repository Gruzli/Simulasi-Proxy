# Proxy
Implementation of the Proxy Design Pattern using the Java programming language. The Proxy Pattern is a structural design pattern used to provide a substitute or intermediary for another object to control access to it.

In a proxy simulation, we typically create a proxy class that has the same interface as the real object. The proxy acts as an intermediary, allowing us to add additional logic before or after accessing the actual object.

Use Cases for Proxy
Access Control: A proxy can restrict access to a particular object.
Lazy Initialization: A proxy will create the actual object only when it is truly needed.
Logging or Monitoring: A proxy can log or monitor access to a specific object.
Caching: A proxy can store a copy of data to reduce the load on the actual object.
